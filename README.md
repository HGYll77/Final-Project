# Final Group Project

## Introduction

Since the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 has continued to spread in the United States. The first reported case occurred in Seattle, Washington. Although everyone did not take it seriously at the time, as the number of reported cases increasing sharply and the situation becoming more severe, everyone was paying attention to the development of the epidemic. Our research and analysis would mainly focuses on the situation in Washington State. 

## Overview

Our target audience is WA residents. For people living in Washington State, they would like to know how the situation is. For example, how many cases are there recently? Is it dangerous for me to go to another county now?

## The Data

For this assignment, We'll use the dataset about "Cases, Hospitalization and Deaths of COVID-19 in WA".  The data originates from Washington State Department of Health and we accessed the data from[https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard#tables]. This data record the number of cases, hospitalizations and death of Covid-19 for different aged groups in each  county weekly. It contains the following variables:

* _**County**_: County names
* _**WeekStartDate**_: date of the first day of that week, as yyyy/mm/dd/
* _**ProbableCases**_: # cases that have symptoms, but no positive molecular test during that week
* _**ConfirmedCases**_: # confirmed cases during that week
* _**TotalCases**_: # ProbableCases + ConfirmedCases
* _**Hospitalizations**_: # hospitalization among confirmed and probable cases during that week
* _**Deaths**_: # deaths among confirmed and probable cases during that week
* _**Age 0-19**_: # cases/hospitalizations/deaths who are from age 0-19
* _**Age 20-34**_: # cases/hospitalizations/deaths who are from age 20-34
* _**Age 35-49**_: # cases/hospitalizations/deaths who are from age 35-49
* _**Age 50-64**_: # cases/hospitalizations/deaths who are from age 50-64
* _**Age 65-79**_: # cases/hospitalizations/deaths who are from age 65-79
* _**Age 80+**_: # cases/hospitalizations/deaths who are aged 80 years or older
